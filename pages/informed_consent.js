				Information sheet for research project &ldquo;Visualizing Differences In
				Fork Ecosystems&rdquo;
			</h1>
			<h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				You have been invited to take part in research project Visualizing
				Differences In Fork Ecosystems , because you provided feedback for the
				GitHub Network Graph on a respective GitHub issue and shared your
				contact information publicly on your profile, or you are a student or
				researcher in computer science at TU/e.
			</p>
			<p>
				Participation in this research project is voluntary: the decision to
				take part is up to you. Before you decide to participate we would like
				to ask you to read the following information, so that you know what the
				research project is about, what we expect from you and how we deal with
				processing your personal data. Based on this information you can
				indicate via the consent declaration whether you consent to take part in
				this research project and the processing of your personal data.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may of course always contact the researcher via
				s.chen1@student.tue.nl if you have any questions, or you can discuss
				this information with people you know.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purpose of the research</h2>
			<p>
				This research project will be managed by Jacob Kr&uuml;ger and Loek
				Cleophas.
			</p>
			<p>
				The purpose of this research project is to develop visualizations that
				help developers explore and understand the evolution of fork ecosystems.
				With a better understanding, the managers or developers can cooperate to
				build more organized and reliable software systems that benefit the
				open-source community. The ideas we have developed are inspired by the
				requests of open-source developers (including you) on an issue for
				improving GitHub&rsquo;s network graph. So, we think you may be
				interested in trying out the visualizations.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
